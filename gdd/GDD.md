## ‚ôªÔ∏è Key Mechanics

### 1. Core Gameplay Elements

-   **Claw:** Player-controlled machine to pick up junk items from the Pile.
-   **Pipe (Junk Pipe):** Delivers junk items into the Pile.
-   **Pile (Junk Pile):** Area where junk items accumulate.
-   **Cauldron:** Main crafting vessel where junk items are transformed into loot. Requires heating.
-   **Furnace:** Burns junk items supplied via the Intake to heat the Cauldron.
-   **Intake:** Chute where player drops junk items destined for the Furnace.
-   **Junk Items:** Raw materials used for both crafting (in Cauldron) and fuel (in Furnace).
-   **Loot Items:** Valuable items crafted from Junk Items in the Cauldron.
-   **Recipes (Templates):** Blueprints required for crafting specific Loot Items. Stored in the Deck.
-   **Deck:** Player's collection of acquired recipes. Supplies the crafting queue.
-   **Stall:** Inventory where crafted Loot Items are stored before selling.
-   **Money:** Currency earned from selling Loot Items, used for purchases in the Shop.
-   **Shop:** Interface for buying recipes, upgrades, and fixing equipment.
-   **Loot Mixer:** A feature in the Shop to create Hybrid Recipes.

### 2. Crafting System

-   Player selects junk items with the Claw and drops them into either the Cauldron (ingredients) or the Intake (fuel).
-   Starting the craft burns fuel in the Furnace, heating the Cauldron.
-   Player stops the process at the desired temperature.
-   Success depends on correct temperature range and ingredients matching a recipe from the queue.
-   Results: Successful craft (Loot Item), failure (too hot/cold, ingredients lost or returned), or wasted fuel.

### 3. Wearing and Fixing

-   Core elements (Claw, Cauldron, Furnace, Intake) degrade with use, impacting performance (e.g., Claw glitches, Cauldron dirtiness affects price, Furnace heats slower, Intake clogs).
-   Requires spending money in the Shop to fix/clean.

## üñ•Ô∏è Visual Style and Interface

-   **Main View:** 2D side-view showing the Claw operating above the Pile, the Cauldron/Intake/Furnace assembly, and the Junk Pipe.
-   **Key UI Elements:** Recipe queue, temperature gauge, Stall access, Day/Money indicators.
-   **Popups:** Day Start, Day End (Statistics), Shop, Stall, Crafting Result, Onboarding Modals.

## üìã Gameplay Process (Phases)

1.  **Day Start**: Shows current day number. Refills recipe queue.
2.  **Day**: Core gameplay loop - receive junk, operate Claw, sort junk into Cauldron/Intake, craft items, place loot in Stall. Repeat until choosing to end the day or resources/equipment prevent continuation.
3.  **Day End (Statistics)**: Review performance (profit/loss, items crafted, etc.), compare with previous days.
4.  **Shop**: Spend earned money to fix equipment, buy base recipes, buy upgrades, or use the Loot Mixer. Proceeds to the next Day Start.

## üí∞ Progression System

### Upgrades (Purchased in Shop)

-   **Cauldron:** Durability, final price buff.
